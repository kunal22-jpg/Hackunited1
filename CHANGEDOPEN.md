# CHANGEDOPEN.MD - OPENAI PERSONALIZED WELLNESS SYSTEM INTEGRATION

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Integration of OpenAI API to create a personalized wellness system that generates structured recommendations for diet, workout, skincare, and health based on user input (weight, allergies, wellness goals, health conditions).

## USER REQUIREMENTS CONFIRMED
✅ **IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**: Add content in circular gallery when user clicks on specific card
✅ **PRODUCT LINKS**: Search links that OpenAI provides (no API integration needed)  
✅ **YOUTUBE VIDEOS**: Links that OpenAI provides (no YouTube API needed)
✅ **IMAGES**: AI decides approach (combination of generated + stock images)
✅ **TESTING**: Test with 1-2 user logins to preserve API credits
✅ **DOCUMENTATION**: Update this file after every single change for account continuity
